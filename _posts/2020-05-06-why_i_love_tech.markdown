 I have always loved technology, whether it was just a video game or just the original Apple computers that you could play Oregon Trail on.  I don't know why in high school I decided to take cosmetology instead of data entry (it is what my school had).   Or why when I went, I first started college I went for business administration.  After I had my first son in2000, I decided to go back to college and finish my degree but I decided I wanted to focus on law, so I obtained my AA in paralegal studies.  I was working at Walmart Pharmacy then and I used to fix the computers when the broke and I really did not do anything magical to them.  I knew if we called the help desk it would take forever.  so usually I could figure out what was going on with them.  

Fast forward a few years to I think it was January this year I was on Instagram and found an ad for Career Karma and it stated that I could get into tech and learn to code and all of that.  So, me being skeptical I'm like okay what is the catch there is always a catch.  It just sounded too good to be true.  It was true.  It was a group that helps support those that want to start a new career and get into tech.  I was like yes, I have always really wanted to do this, this sounds like my dream job! When I become a software engineer, I can literally work anywhere I want. Especially now that so many jobs have gone remote, I can code in my pajamas, from the beach, from Paris if I wanted.  I want to help my kids and family have a better life. I also want to help other people through my coding.

Someday I hope to acquire the skills to develop things that can help people. Whether it be apps for education for maybe helping kids all over the world to read.  maybe making proper medical devices, we know right know the world needs all the help they can get with medical help.  It could help find a better way to track resources for cov-19, supplies, ppe, medicine, suppliers, trucks, routes, and manufactures. I always wanted to do amazing things and now I have that opportunity to do so!  

I am so excited for my new career; I am so thankful for everyone that has helped me so far on my journey.  you guys are truly angels!
