The first project has really been a struggle for me.  I will be glad when my skills improve and I am more capable to figure out these basic steps.  I have changed project ideas 4 different times so needless to say, I am a little behind.  At first, I was going to make a ruby gem with details from the api from a pharmaceutical company and the effects of the malaria drug Hydoxychloroquine (Plaquniquil), as a possible treatment for the Corona virus- Covid-19. I was also going to update the world app data website that showed all the numbers of the infected along with survivors and those not so fortunate. Then in the news they were speaking how the medication wasn’t helping and it wasn’t and could possibly be damaging.  I had seen a video stating that they also took it off the market so they could make money on the vaccine, either way, the stories are conflicting so I changed my mind.  Then after I start something else, now the doctors think that the medication Pepcid, (Famotine). In Wuhan, early in the outbreak, doctors noticed that some of the older patients that survived had been sufferers of heartburn and had been taking Famotine. The doctors concluded that those taking that medication died at a rate at about of half the rate of those not taking it. This medication could be binding to an enzyme needed by the virus to replicate itself.  Clinical trials and lab work will on the way soon including placebo testing.

My second project that I was working on I had downloaded everything I needed again as well. I was almost ready to start coding. I had asked my cohort lead a few questions about it and he was looking over the information and I noticed him looking at it strangely.  After I talked to him about it, I was looked at it again and realized what he probably seen.  The api had was about top Anime and different characters in different shows.  Well one of them had been extremely inappropriate and was it was describing very creepy things about young girls so there was no way I was doing that. I don’t have much else to explain about this project, it could be a really cool ruby gem if I was able to finish that one. On to the next project.

My third project and actually ended up being my final project in a Game of Thrones cli with a ruby gem api built inside, I really haven’t been able to figure out what this gem does as of yet but I am still trying to figure it out.  I also used the same api as well so I didn’t feel like I did not do the correct amount of work. This api will allow user to choose a book, then a character from the books. It will also let you choose houses and other details as well like information about the characters.  The main problems I have been having is with my computer. There is not anything physically wrong with it, it is the fact that I am used to old windows 7, yes 7. So, when I try to do many things with my mac it does not work the same way and I seriously make a mess with the files. I still had Atom installed and when I accessed GitHub to bring my files into my visual studio code, let’s just say first they were stuck in the GitHub app, then my master copy was stuck in Atom. Then I down loaded it again and then deleted Atom, well some of the files disappeared. So yeah, it’s been really fun. 

I had started a fourth project and tried to get it right, I just don’t have time to get it up and running correctly, I got the basis of it, but I wasn’t able to get it functioning properly. I really appreciate all of the help that I have received. If I had more time to work on ![](![](![](http://)http://)http://)my fourth project, I was going to write about superhero stats and stuff like that. It is a random api that will let the user pick the superhero and then you can have stats and strength and all kinds of stuff come into play. This could be an amazing gem! Thanks for listening or reading about my first project, fingers crossed that it will work!
